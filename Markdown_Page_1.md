Video Games are a common entertainment activity today.

You can find different ways to play a type of video game on almost any device today, such as on TVs with gaming focused hardware connected, on smartphone devices, and even on older computers.

In fact, some of the first earliest known video games came out in the late 1940s to early 1950s!

A few of these games include:

+ 1952 "Checkers" (also known as "Draughts")
+ 1952 "OXO" (A tic-tac-toe game)
+ 1958 "Tennis for Two"
+ 1962 "Spacewar!"

Before Video Games became more common and can be found on almost any everyday eletrionic device, they were more often found in public *Arcades*.

One of, first few arcade game was called "**Computer Space**". A game where the play flies a rocket on the screen and tries to shoot the saucers shooting back at the player.
