There are different types of Exercises.

| Exercise Type | Description | Focus| Workouts examples|
| --------------|-------------|------|---------|
| **Cardiovascular** (also known as "*Cardio*" or "*Aerobic*") | Cardio exercise worked to imrpve heart and lung health using constant movement that increased the heart rate.| +Heart +Lunges +Endurance | -Running -Swimming -Jump Rope -Walking -Dance -Sprints|
| **Strength** (also known as "*Resistance*") | Strength exercise works and builds muscles, improves strength, bone density and metabolism. | +Muscles +Bone Health | -Weightlifting -Calisthenics -Powerlifting|
| **Flexibility** (*Mobility*) | Flexibility works on improving joint health and someones ability to bend with a range of motion | +Joints +Posture +Lower Muscle Injury Risk | -Yoga -Pilates -Static & Dynamic Stretching |
| **Balance** | Balance helps keep coordination with your body. As well as improving joint stability and athletic performace. | +Coordination +Balance +stable Muscles | -Single-leg exercises -Tai Chi|
| **Power** |  Power or Plyometric exercises help to improve explosive strength, along with speed and agility. These exerces are important for athletes. They help improve being faster. | +Speed +Agility +Explosive Strength | -Box jumps -Jump Squats|
| **Core** | Core training works to improve core strength, which is important for most other activity. Very often, it will overlap with Strength and Flexibility training. | +Improves posture +Overall Movement | -Planks -Leg raises -Ab rollouts|
| **Functional** | Functional exercises broadly covers everyday movements but with a higher focus on practical strength. | +Overall full-body movements | -Kettlebell swings -Deadlifts -Squats|
| **Recovery** | Recovery Exercises work to improve recovery of muscles and circulation. These are done usually after a workout or after a mild injury. These has low-impact and can allow people with poor joints and weaker muscles. | +Muscles +joints +Heart | -Walking -Light Yoga -Stretching|

## Repetitions and Sets
During workouts, you would have a series of Sets and within each Set you would do a number of Repetitions (or *Reps* for short). 

One example of this would be doing Push-ups.

| Sets | Reps | rest between sets|
|------|------|------------------|
| 3 | 15 | 2 to 5 minutes for **Strength** and **Power**|
or
| 4 | 10 | 30 to 60 seconds for **Endurance** and **Conditioning**|

## Workout Goals
There are different goals someone might have with their workouts. Learning your needs or wants will allow you to focus on *'how'* to go about it.
There are a few list of goals of what you might want to focus on.

| Goal | Description| Example case|
|------|------------|-------------|
|Strength| This goal works on being able to use more force with your muscles.| Light heavy weights|
|Hypertrophy| This works on building muscle size. This also increases muscle strength a little bit| Larger looking Arms|
|Endurace| Endurace focuses on allowing muscles to keep going or reduce fatigue over time. | Allows for MORE actvity such as doing more push-ups|
|Power| Power works to be more faster or use more explosive movements.| Faster punches, kicks, sprints, etc.|
|Fat loss| This goal focues on workouts that burn more overall calories to help with body fat index | Fat Loss|

There are a few notes to make about these goals. While some of them might overlap with each other, they play different roles in a body workout.

One example would be Hypertrophy and Strength. Hypertrophy builds muscle size, and while more muscle mass allows for more strength, it DOESN'T mean more Strength in general. Strength workouts trains nerves to call more muscle.

**Hypertrophy != Strength**

You can think of it as Hypertrophy allows for more potential force, while strength allows the ability to USE those muscles.
